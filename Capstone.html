								<h2>Quasar Ineractive (Capstone Team)</h2>
								<p>Game: Ichor Burns</p>
							</header>

							<h3>Game Summary</h3>
							<p>
								Ichor Burns is a free-to-play, single-player, 3D, third-person, action-adventure, roguelike
								game with deck-building features in the form of spells and stat upgrades, created by a team
								of 10 artists and programmers using the Unreal Engine. The game is done in an anime style
								inspired by Genshin Impact. The game is designed around player freedom, with each spell
								catering to different playstyles and a huge and customizable accessibility setting system.
								Ichor Burns is also the first place winner at Level Up Showcase 2025 in Toronto for accessibility.
							</p>

							<h3>What I Did</h3>
							<p>
								I was one of the programmers on the team. I created, designed, and prototyped the spell system,
								many enemy AI behaviour trees, all enemy EQS systems, and some of the accessibility settings
							</p>

							<p>
								The spell system was the first thing I was tasked with in the team, and it consisted of the spell
								item, the spells which are children of projectile, and the spell inventory. I created all spell
								items and the base class for projectiles, as well as created all spell projectiles besides shield,
								making sure my code was readable and flexible so anyone could make their own. I also prototyped
								the spell inventory and presented it to the team before handing it off to a teammate.
							</p>

							<p>
								The enemies were split between me and another teammate. I created many of the services and decorators 
								that are used in the behaviour trees, as well as fully created the carrier enemy behaviour tree. 
								I also majorly changed the melee and ranged enemies' behaviour trees to better interact with the 
								player. Furthermore, I created and designed all 5 enemies' EQS systems that they use to more dynamically 
								move around the world.
							</p>

							<p>
								The accessibility settings were also split between me and another teammate. I was responsible 
								for the creation and imputation of the graphic settings, colour blind modes, and the inverted 
								scroll wheel option. This was mostly done with Unreal blueprints. I also performed extensive 
								testing for the colour blind modes, graphic setting edge cases, and localization.
